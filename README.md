# Welcome to Aurora/Nemo!

A local AI assistant project built in Python using TTS, STT, and memory logging.

---
I designed and implemented the system architecture, integrating speech-to-text, real-time audio processing, and text-to-speech directly on a Raspberry Pi under hardware and latency constraints.

Aurora was the name of the original app. Since then, the name has evolved. Today, the project is called "Nemo," even though some parts still reference Aurora.

Full transparency: I wrote the core system logic myself; AI tools and online forums were used selectively for debugging, library usage (e.g. `resampy`), and understanding documentation.

This submission is the first finished iteration of Nemo. Future work on this project (not included here) will improve audio persistence. I am also considering scaling via a paid API key and working on a 3-D printed UX design. 


Thank you for your consideration!
