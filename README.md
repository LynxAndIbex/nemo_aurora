# Welcome to Aurora/Nemo!

A local AI assistant project built in Python using TTS, STT, and memory logging.

---

Aurora was the name of the original app. Since then, the name has evolved. Today, the project is called "Nemo," even though some parts still reference Aurora.

Full transparency: AI was used for debugging and forums helped understand certain libraries (e.g., `resampy`). I discuss these citations in my maker portfolio.

This was a fun project, but there’s still more to learn. By the time you’re reading this, I’m actively scaling it to run independently and debugging last-minute issues (like saving audio files).

Thank you for your consideration! Enjoy!
